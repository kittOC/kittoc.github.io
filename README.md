# Welcome to kitt4sme's Open Call Projects

We'll be using this github-organization for asynchronous interaction. 

**--Jump over to [Discussions](https://github.com/kittOC/FAQs-and-Technical-issues/discussions) to review existing questions and FAQs.--**   
If you want to ask a new question, you will need to create a new issue through your Project and assign it to your mentor. The mentor will take it to the technical team.

We'll try to keep FAQs primarily for technical issues that may come-up on the way towards integration to the kitt4sme platform. 

Don't worry! All other Project Management issues will be communicated to you on time, by your mentor and (more formally) via e-mail. Just to make sure that none of us misses out of the important stuff!

## How to use

Andrea updates this page with **questions received by** the projects' **mentors**. He'll also create a secret `gist` and share the link here. This way you can still interact with him...asynchronously.
